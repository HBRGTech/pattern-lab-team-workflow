## SASS and Pattern-Lab team workflow using Vagrant

HBR.org’s redesigned website launched on November 10. The HBR Tech team wanted to take advantage of css pre-processing and other recent technologies, but with multiple developers in different environments (Mac, PC and Linux), they faced a workflow challenge. The team developed a solution on top of github-hosted Vagrant virtual machine configurations packaging everything from ubuntu to sass compilation managed by grunt, all to power local Pattern Lab environments.

HBR developers Daigo Fujiwara, Matt Wagner, Fred Lalande, Kevin Davis, and other team members will talk about the process and tools they used.

Topics covered:
* HBR’s front-end team workflow: github - vagrant/puppet - sass(ruby) - pattern lab(php) - grunt/bower(node.js) - jenkins
* Pros and cons of working with Vagrant
* Overview of atomic web design and using front-end pattern library/style guides such as pattern-lab (http://patternlab.io)
* HBR's OOCSS approach using "Helper" classes
* Working with bower and grunt
* Working with Zurb Foundation

Come join us at 6 pm for refreshments, snacks and conversation. Talk will start at 7 p.m.

The event will be hosted and sponsored by the Harvard Business Review.

The Harvard Business Review offices are located at 300 North Beacon St in Watertown, MA inside The Arsenal on the Charles office park. There is plenty of parking. Directions are on the website.
