# SASS and Pattern-Lab team workflow using Vagrant/Puppet

CASCADE BOS | Tues., November 18 @ HBR

by **Kevin Newman, Daigo Fujiwara, Fred Lalande and Matt Wagner**

# Welcome

HBR.org’s redesigned website launched on November 10. 

.small[The HBR Tech team wanted to take advantage of css pre-processing and other recent technologies, but with multiple developers in different environments (Mac, PC and Linux), they faced a workflow challenge.

The team developed a solution on top of github-hosted Vagrant virtual machine configurations packaging everything from ubuntu to sass compilation managed by grunt, all to power local Pattern Lab environments.

HBR developers Kevin Newman, Daigo Fujiwara, Matt Wagner, and Fred Lalande will talk about the process and tools they used.]

# Responsive Web Design


---


### Before


![img](img/old-site.png)

---

### After

![img](img/am-i-responsive.png)


---
class: middle

### Tools and approaches:
* SCSS (build using grunt "grunt-contrib-compass")
* Atomic Web Design/Pattern Lab
* Modular CSS / Object Oriented CSS approach
* Zurb Foundation 
* Require.js to r.js AMD javascript (JavaScrpt will not be covered in this talk)

---
class: middle

### What made it possible:
* Github 
* Vagrant
* Jenkins 
* Grunt 

---
class: middle


### Dependencies: 
* Pattern Lab = PHP +  Apache 
* Grunt, Bower = Node.js
* Sass/Compass = Ruby

Old site - homepage only 77 KB, but **16 HTTP request** for stylesheets

New site - homepage (and ALL the other pages) **ONE http request** cached by Amazon cloudfront (but large, 180 KB)

## Our **main goal** going into the redesign was to write _reusable, flexible, scalable, modular, pattern-based_, front-end code. 

---
class: center, middle, inverse


# Object-Oriented CSS 



---
class: middle
## Object-oriented CSS, or OOCSS. 

A term and methodology coined by Nicole Sullivan

[github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki)

---
class: center, middle
### Instead of one monolithic piece of code to complete tasks ABC, you’d end up with **each of A , B and C** abstracted into its own object. Now we’d have A which we can combine with either B or C in any order we choose.

  -- _Harry Roberts_

# Two rules 

1.  **Separate "Structure" and "Skin"**
     - Structure contains core of an object and skin extends its visual representation. 
2.  **Separate "Container" and "Content"**
      - Avoid location-dependent styles. 


---
class: middle

# Single responsibility principle 

### **code that does one job, one job only, and one job very well.**

---
class: center, middle

### Next step: Taking that reusable, scalable css object into grouped HTML object?

# Atomic Web Design 

---
class: middle

Created by **Brad Frost**, creator of [this is responsive](http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/) pattern library 

### Atomic web design is a methodology used to construct web design systems. 

---

class: middle

### Designing **"Web pages"** doesn't make sense anymore. 

### With different screen sizes, pixel perfection &amp; designing the same experience for "all devices" is not possible.

But our reality still consists of design review meetings where people look over static mock-ups.

---
class: middle

### Web sites are living things that fill a variety of containers.

# **EMBRACE THE FLUIDITY OF THE WEB!**

### Instead of page-based designs, we need **design systems**. 
---

class: center, middle
![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)
**Atoms** on the Web are HTML elements like: h1, p, div, button, etc. More abstract atoms include colors and fonts. Combining atoms, you get **molecules**, molecules create **organisms**, and so on. 

Each of them is **on its own, responsive**. 

---
class: middle

![img](img/atomic-web-design.gif)
Think of molecules and organisms as **Lego-like building blocks** designed to be combined together. Combined, they become **templates**, and ultimately **pages**. 

Atomic design allows us to traverse from abstract to concrete (in context), so you can find reusable pieces / building-blocks more easily, and only evolve certain section of the page.

# Front end Style Guide


---
class: middle
### A browser-based web front-end style guide, an interface inventory, or pattern library, can help us with:
* Design Consistency
* Code Standards (i.e. html structure, css class names)
* Responsive Web Design

---
class: middle
### Benefits of a front-end style guide

* Being able to test responsive design ("Where does this design break?")
* Improved workflow (Feedback / collaboration "Designing/deciding in the browser.")
* Shared vocabulary (Design/Tech/Edit "What do you call this building block?")
* Future reference ("What's available? What needs to be designed/coded next?")

Adapted from [Front-end Style Guides](http://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/) by Anna Debenham

---
class: middle
## Examples of front-end style guide
* [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel)
* [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com/static/reference/styleguide/)
* [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/styleguide)
* [Debenham's style guide collection](https://gimmebar.com/collection/4ecd439c2f0aaad734000022/front-end-styleguides-and-pattern-libraries)

---
class: middle
### Those style guides are great, but...
* Time consuming to create
* Seen only as a designer/developer tool
* Often too abstract
* Often too incomplete and/or out-of-date

---
class: middle, center
## Instead of writing style guide after redesign is finished, we built &amp; tested small building-blocks that later **_became_** our front-end style guide.

# Pattern Lab 

---
class: middle
![img](img/pattern-lab.png)
[patternlab.io](http://patternlab.io)

An open sourced tool to create the Atomic Web Design system that will become the "living" front-end style guide. 

(also created by Brad Frost. Maintained by Dave Olsen on github)

---
class: middle
## What did Pattern-Lab give us?
* Visual library of building blocks
* View-port resizer
* Code viewer / Template creator (using mustache)

---
class: middle

## Creation process 

---

# Build systems, not pages

# Zurb Foundation

---

![img](img/foundation.svg)

---
class: middle

### Foundation strength
* Written in SASS
* Open Source/large community
* Well documented
* Mobile First grid system
* Built in media query
* rem based units
* Loaded via Bower
